This document contains the working draft of the Tracks specification by the
[Cell Migration Standardisation Organisation (CMSO)](https://cmso.science/).

The current specification is based on the following computational workflow:

1. A **segmentation algorithm** detects objects of interest (i.e. cells) in a set of microscopy images
2. A **linking algorithm** links these objects in time
3. A **segment linking** processes the segments and produces final tracks
